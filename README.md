## Approach

The purpose of `brevity-bot` is to take a complicated failing build log and produce a more bite-sized output. In addition to the failed tests or the syntax error, it will give a programming related quote to keep it light-hearted.

It works like this:
1. A repo owner creates a PR check for Travis CI and installs `brevity-bot`
1. A user creates a PR
1. Travis CI runs the tests and produces a build
1. `brevity-bot` receieves a `status` webhook
1. Discards all `status` webhook payload conclusions that are not `failing`
1. Use the payload `target_url` to get the build log from Travis CI
1. Parse the build log for TAP output
1. Post the output as a comment on the pull request

## Requirements

* [Node >=8.3.0](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/)
* A [TAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol) producing test harness such as [`tape`](https://github.com/substack/tape)
* [Travis CI](https://github.com/marketplace/travis-ci) for your Pull Request builds

## Development Setup

```sh
# get the bot code
git clone git@github.com:dannyfritz/brevity-bot.git
cd brevity-bot
```

### Create a GitHub App

1. Follow the instructions at [probot](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app)
  * For permissions select:
    * `pull requests` - `read & write`
    * `commit statuses` - `read-only`
  * For webhooks select:
    * `status`

### Run the Bot

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot in watch mode
npm run dev
```

## Testing

```sh
# To run the tests
npm test
```

## Deployment

When you are done developing, you can [deploy the bot](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/).
